Here will be a site about Ozolnieki :D

Considering that the city does not even have a basic website, I will need to make a complete website, with various basic information, possible references to interesting places, history of the city, etc.

<strong> With what information do we start over here?</strong>
<li>Ozolnieki doesn't have it's own website</li>
<li>Not really enoguh information about city in the internet</li>
<li>Presumably, city has a rich social and cultural life</li>
<li>There is a renovated secondary school, there is a waterpark in one of its lakes, near of it were Napoleon fortifications</li>
<li>Administrative center of Ozolniek parish, if that's even worth mentioning</li>

<strong> So,what's our plan for it is?</strong>
<li>Links and description of the main administrative buildings and development clubs? Considering most of those don't have more than 1 mention on the internet, it will be hard thing to do</li>
<li>Information about events in the city</li>
<li>A notice board for residents,where they can find last news</li>
<li>Information about public transportation,if there even is any</li>
<li>Maybe schedule of work for administrative institutions (hospitals, client departments)</li>

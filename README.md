Here is the site: https://ozolnieki.wordpress.com/

Considering that the city does not even have a basic website, I will need to make a complete website, with various basic information, possible references to interesting places, history of the city, etc.

<strong> With what information do we start over here?</strong>
<li>Ozolnieki doesn't have it's own website</li>
<li>Not really enoguh information about city in the internet</li>
<li>Presumably, city has a rich social and cultural life</li>
<li>There is a renovated secondary school, there is a waterpark in one of its lakes, near of it were Napoleon fortifications</li>
<li>Administrative center of Ozolniek parish, if that's even worth mentioning</li>

<strong> So,what's our plan for it is?</strong>
<li>Links and description of the main administrative buildings and development clubs? Considering most of those don't have more than 1 mention on the internet, it will be hard thing to do</li>
<li>Information about events in the city</li>
<li>A notice board for residents,where they can find last news</li>
<li>Information about public transportation,if there even is any</li>
<li>Maybe schedule of work for administrative institutions (hospitals, client departments)</li>

<strong> What we have done already?</strong>
<li>Main page, on which there is little bit of history, where the name comes from, and recent news</li>
<li>News archive page, on which we can see all the news(first variant), to be choosen</li>
<li>News archive page, on which we can see all the news(second variant), to be choosen</li>
<li>Bus stops page, where are placed all the bus stops as a list, and a interactive map, which could help finding those</li>

<strong> Maybe,some suggestions?</strong>
<li>Probably, to add some about current weather and etc</li>
<li>Maybe, to add another page, on which would be information about administrative buildings and their hours of work(i still didn't found them)</li>
